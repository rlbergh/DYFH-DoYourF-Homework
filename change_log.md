# Change log:

## 12/1/2025
  - Added a settings button in the footer status bar which will open a dialog box to:
    1. Manage Zoom links of classes (accessible via clicking total time KPI badges)
    2. Archive old classes
    3. "Delete completed" (button moved from main UI)
  - Added a "Show archived classes" button to toggle them on and off
  - Changed the colors of various buttons for more seemless user experience
  - Moved the "Delete completed" button to the settings dialog box to avoid inadvertant clicking
  - Added tooltips to KPIs (they quick filter to class if a Zoom link is not provided)
  - Removed "IMT" from the course name by default. It's now whatever is typed into/selected from the Class field dropdown box
